<p><strong>Properties</strong> are containers that hold other objects, primitive values or functions. Object that provides shared properties for other objects. Part of an object that associates a key (String or Symbol) and a value.
Every object created by a constructor has an implicit reference (called the object&#39;s prototype)
to the value of its constructor&#39;s &quot;prototype&quot; property.</p>
<p>Properties can be added to objects dynamically by assigning values to them.</p>
<p>A <strong>primitive value</strong> is a member of one of the following built-in types:
Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, BigInt, Symbol, String.</p>
<p>An <strong>object</strong> is a member of the built-in type Object.
An object is a collection of zero or more properties each with attributes
that determine how each property can be used.
The prototype may be the null value.</p>
<p>A <strong>function</strong> is a callable object. A function that is associeded with an object via
a property is called a <strong>method</strong>.
When a function is called as a method of an object, the object is passed to the function
as its <em>this</em> value. In addition to its properties, a function contains executable code and
state that determine how it behaves when invoked.</p>
<p>Defined functions are not required to have their declaration appear textually before calls to them.</p>
<p>Objects are created by using constructors in <code>new</code> expressions.
Alternatively, a new object may be created with an explicitly specified prototype using
the <code>Object.create</code> built-in function.</p>
<p>String<br>Each integer value in the sequence usually represents a single 16-bit unit of UTF-16 text.</p>
<p>attribute<br>Internal value that defines some characteristic of a property.</p>
<p>To specify an empty regular expression, use <code>/(?:)/</code></p>
<p>The export keyword is used to export things. It may appear in front of a function, class, or binding definition (let, const, or var).</p>

<p><code>never</code> is a type of values that never occur. There are no possible values of type never, not even null or undefined.</p>
